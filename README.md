Java Magic 8-Ball
-----------------

Amaze your friends with the spooky predictions of the Java Magic 8-Ball. It knows all.
Ignore the words of the Magic 8-Ball at your own peril.

-----------------

This is a side-project I did during the back-half of the Java cohort at Tech Elevator 
to keep my skills up. There's nothing too fancy here: just a basic UI and the 8-Ball
responses are stored in a simple array. The output is randomized when a question is
posed. Like I said, it's simple and was fun to make.
